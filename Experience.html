    <h1>My Experiences About Jvp International School</h1>    
    <p>JVP INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL is one of the most prestigious school in the city, with the vision of attaining global recognition.</p>
    <p>Each student in the school comes under the responsibility of a mentor. The mentor is in regular touch with his /her mentee and keeps record of the childs activities, academic as well as co-curricular. Regular mentor meetings will be held where children are free to interact with their mentor. The mentor also keeps in touch with the parents to give and receive feedback on student.</p>
