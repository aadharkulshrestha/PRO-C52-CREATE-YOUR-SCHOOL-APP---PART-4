            Dear Students,
            
            In my earnest attempt to delineate the prospects that your child would have at our institution, it becomes my prime responsibility to put to you the idealogy and conviction inherent in the foundation of JVP International School, An extract from ones saying ...your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of lifes longing for itself... you are the bows, from which your children as living arrows are sent forth. The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and he bends you with all his might, that his arrows may go swift and far. Let your bending in the Archers hand be for gladness; for even as he loves the arrows that flies, so he loves the bow that is stable...
            
            We believe that a childs education is a shared process where home and school, work in a partnership for the mutual benefit of the child. The aims of the school is to develop its pupils educationally and morally to their full potential and help them to become informed human beings equipped to take their place in the community as responsible citizens.
            
            With your support, our confident team will surely set high standards in the field of education in the times to come. The students at JVP International School will experience the joys of discovery, rather that just be quantities measured by numerical scores or letters of the alphabet."</h2>
